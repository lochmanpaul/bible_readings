# Daily Bible Readings
A browser-based application to provide daily bible readings.

This is a simple browser utility that will set out three varied bible readings for each day of the year. If all three readings are completed each day, the user will have read the entire sixty-six books of the Bible within one year. Alternatively, the readings can be spread over three years by following column one in the first year, column two in the second year and column three in the third year.

In most cases, readings are based on entire chapters, although some of the longer psalms are divided into smaller sections by verses. The books of the New Testament (in year three) are arranged in such a way that the entire New Testament is read twice in one year.

The application includes links to two popular, online versions of the Bible: Net Bible and YouVersion. The links are automatically updated for each new day and, provided the user is online, will load the relevant section for that day and year. There are also links to some additional resources provided by Bible Hub. These include dictionaries, commentaries and a Bible Atlas.

The application is written in PHP and requires to run in conjunction with a MySQL database. It can be set up on a local or external server.
