### To install the Bible Readings module, you need to take four steps:

1. Set up a new MySQL database using the SQL script: [readings.sql]
2. Create a folder in your server root called "readings".
3. Copy all the PHP files, the XML file and the CSS file to this folder.
4. Start the application in your browser with this URL: "/readings/readings.php".
   NB: The leading forward slash in the URL is important!
